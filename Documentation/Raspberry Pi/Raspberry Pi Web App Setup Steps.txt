Raspberry Pi Web App Deployment Steps

1. ZeroTier Setup
Download and install ZeroTier from:

    https://www.zerotier.com/download/

Join the ZeroTier network using the provided network ID:

    sudo zerotier-cli join 68bea79acf0eb4e9

Notify the network admin to accept your device into the network.
Once accepted, connect to the Raspberry Pi via SSH:

    ssh <username>@<ip address>

2. System Preparation
Updated and upgraded system packages:

    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
    sudo dpkg --configure -a

Removed package manager locks and reconfigured dpkg as needed.

3. Git Installation & Configuration
Installed Git:

    sudo apt install git -y
    git --version

Generated SSH keys for GitHub authentication:

    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email"
    eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
    ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

Configured Git user details:

    git config --global user.name "<username>"
    git config --global user.email "<email>"

Verified SSH connection to GitHub:

    ssh -T git@github.com

4. Docker Installation
Installed Docker and related dependencies:

    sudo apt install -y ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release
    curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh
    sudo apt install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin

Added current user to the Docker group (to run Docker without sudo):

    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
    newgrp docker

5. Repository Cloning
Cloned the web app repository:

    git clone https://github.com/Do-Not-Erase/BucStop.git


The web app was run, but is currently in a broken state.
All steps above were performed on a Raspberry Pi running Linux.
SSH keys were generated and added for secure GitHub access.
Docker was installed using the official convenience script and package manager.
ZeroTier was used for networking, but setup commands are not shown in the provided history.
