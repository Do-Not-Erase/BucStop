Option 1:
Rarity	Percentage
Common	50%
Uncommon	25%
Rare	15%
Ultra	7%
Omega	3%

That means on any given draw, a player has:

a 1 in 2 chance of getting a common
a 1 in 4 chance of getting an uncommon
a 1 in ~7 chance of getting a rare
a 1 in ~14 chance of getting an ultra
a 1 in ~33 chance of getting an omega

Option 2: 12 Card Types + Rarity Distribution (Detailed Odds)

First, the game randomly selects one of 12 card types
 - Each card type has a 1 in 12 chance (~8.33%)

Second, the rarity of that card is determined using this distribution:
Rarity	Percentage
Common	50%
Uncommon	25%
Rare	15%
Ultra	7%
Omega	3%

That means on any given draw, a player has:

a 1 in 2 chance of getting a common
a 1 in 4 chance of getting an uncommon
a 1 in ~7 chance of getting a rare
a 1 in ~14 chance of getting an ultra
a 1 in ~33 chance of getting an omega

Odds of Getting a Specific Card at a Specific Rarity
Because every card type has the same rarity distribution, we multiply the chance of getting that card type (1/12) by the rarity percentage.

Rarity	Combined Chance (per card)
Common	(1/12 × 50%) ≈ 4.17%
Uncommon	(1/12 × 25%) ≈ 2.08%
Rare	(1/12 × 15%) ≈ 1.25%
Ultra	(1/12 × 7%) ≈ 0.58%
Omega	(1/12 × 3%) ≈ 0.25%

A specific common version of a card: ~4.17% chance
A specific uncommon version of a card: ~2.08% chance
A specific rare version of a card: ~1.25% chance
A specific ultra version of a card: ~0.58% chance
A specific omega version of a card: ~0.25% chance
