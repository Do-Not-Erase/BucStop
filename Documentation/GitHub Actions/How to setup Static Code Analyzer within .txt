How to Set Up Static Code Analyzer within GitHub

Static code analysis (SCA) checks your source code for issues without running it. It’s used to:
* Detect security flaws and logic errors early
* Enforce coding standards and best practices
* Improve maintainability and reduce technical debt
Set Up CodeQL in GitHub
Step 1: Enable GitHub Actions
Go to your repository:
Settings ? Actions ? General ? Allow all actions and reusable workflows
Make sure Actions are enabled.
Step 2: Add a CodeQL Workflow
Path :  .github/workflows/static-analysis.yml :
name: CodeQL Analysis

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  analyze:
    name: Analyze code with CodeQL
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      actions: read
      contents: read
      security-events: write

    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        language: [ 'javascript', 'python', 'c-cpp', 'java' ]  # adjust as needed

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Initialize CodeQL
      uses: github/codeql-action/init@v3
      with:
        languages: ${{ matrix.language }}

    - name: Build project
      run: |
        echo "Build step goes here"
        # e.g., make, npm install, mvn compile, etc.

    - name: Perform CodeQL Analysis
      uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v3

Step 3: Commit and Push
git add .github/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml
git commit -m "Add CodeQL static analysis workflow"
git push

Step 4: Make sure it is working
Go to:
GitHub ? Actions tab ? CodeQL Analysis
You should see a running or completed workflow.
When it finishes:
* Visit Security ? Code scanning alerts
* You’ll see detailed findings (security issues, code smells, etc.)
