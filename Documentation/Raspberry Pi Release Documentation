üîÅ Update Application on Raspberry Pi (New Release Workflow)
1Ô∏è‚É£ Navigate to the App Directory
cd /BucStop


This is the folder where you originally cloned the repo.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Pull the Latest Changes from GitHub
git pull origin main


Replace main with your default branch name if it's different (like master or dev).
We're deploying from main currently but can implement a staging branch later.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Rebuild the Docker Image
docker compose up


This will build the image with the latest code.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Restart the Container
Option 1: Stop and Remove the Existing Container(s)
docker stop my-container-name
docker rm my-container-name


Container names:
bucstop, api-gateway, game-tetris, game-snake, game-pong

Option 2: Run a New Container with the Updated Image
docker run -d --name my-container-name -p 80:80 my-app-name


Use --restart unless-stopped if you want automatic restarts.
App name: BucStop
Container names: see above.

‚úÖ Optional: Use Tags or Versioning

If you're using GitHub releases or tagging:

git fetch --all
git checkout tags/v1.2.3 -b release-v1.2.3


Then follow the build and run steps again.
